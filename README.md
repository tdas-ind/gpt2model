# gpt2model

GPT-2 Implementation:

This repository contains a basic implementation of GPT-2. The model has been optimized to run efficiently on a CPU, but please note that no GPU optimizations, such as Torch Distributed Data Parallel, have been applied due to limited compute resources. Additionally, evaluation code is not included in this repository.

Purpose: 

This project is purely for learning purposes. It is based on my exploration of GPT-2 inspired by Andrej Karpathy's excellent videos. I highly recommend checking out his content for a deeper understanding and a more comprehensive learning experience.

Acknowledgments: 

Kudos to Andrej Karpathy for his incredible educational videos that have greatly influenced this project.
